# Project Baksho Backend

Project Baksho is a full-stack crowdfunding platform built with a microservices architecture. This document provides instructions for setting up and running the **backend** of the application.

---

## üìñ Overview

The backend consists of several independent microservices, each responsible for a specific part of the system. These microservices are orchestrated via an **API Gateway** and a **Service Registry**. Communication happens over HTTP, with authentication and authorization handled at the gateway level.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose
* JDK 17+
* Maven
* Node.js + npm/pnpm
* Python 3.11+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd muhtasim-zawad-project_baksho
```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

3. Start all backend services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and run containers for all microservices.

## üåê Services & Endpoints

### API Gateway

* **Tech**: Spring Boot
* **Port**: `8080`
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Reverse proxy for all requests
  * JWT authentication & authorization
  * Injects user headers (`X-User-Id`, `X-User-Name`)

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8080`

---

### Service Registry

* **Tech**: Spring Boot (Eureka)
* **Port**: `8761`
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Registers microservices
  * Enables dynamic discovery

**Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8761`

---

### User Service

* **Tech**: Node.js (Express), MongoDB
* **Port**: `5001`
* **Responsibilities**:

  * User registration & login
  * JWT token generation
  * Profile management

**Base URL (via Gateway)**: `/api/users`

---

### Campaign Service

* **Tech**: Python (FastAPI), SQLite
* **Port**: `8001`
* **Responsibilities**:

  * CRUD for crowdfunding campaigns
  * Incentive tier management

**Base URL (via Gateway)**: `/campaigns`

---

## üîë Authentication

* Authentication is handled by the **API Gateway** using **JWT**.
* Protected endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_access_token>
```

* The gateway injects:

  * `X-User-Id`
  * `X-User-Name`

into downstream service requests.

---

## API Documentation for Project Baksho

### General Information

**Base URL**: All requests from the client should be made to the API Gateway at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Authentication**:
- Most endpoints are protected and require a JSON Web Token (JWT) to be passed in the `Authorization` header.
- The format is `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_access_token>`.
- Public endpoints, such as login and registration, do not require this header.

**Headers on Protected Routes**:
When a request is made to a protected route, the API Gateway validates the JWT and adds the following headers to the request before forwarding it to the downstream microservice:
-   `X-User-Id`: The unique ID of the authenticated user.
-   `X-User-Name`: The name of the authenticated user.
These headers are used by the microservices for authorization and ownership checks.

## üõ† Development Notes

* **User Service**: Connected to MongoDB instance (defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
* **Campaign Service**: Uses SQLite for persistence; stored inside the container.
* **API Gateway**: All external requests must pass through here.
* **Service Registry**: Ensure it's running before API Gateway & microservices.
